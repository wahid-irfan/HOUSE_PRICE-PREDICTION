# HOUSE_PRICE-PREDICTION

Linear regression is a statistical method that can be used to predict a continuous variable from one or more other variables. In the case of house pricing, we can use linear regression to predict the price of a house from its features, such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the location, and so on.

The basic idea behind linear regression is that there is a linear relationship between the independent variables (the features of the house) and the dependent variable (the price of the house). This means that we can model the price of the house as a linear function of the features of the house.

The equation for a linear regression model is:

y = mx + b
where:

y is the predicted price of the house
m is the slope of the line
b is the y-intercept
x is the independent variable (the feature of the house)
The slope of the line, m, tells us how much the price of the house changes for every unit change in the independent variable. For example, if the slope is 10, then for every additional bedroom, the price of the house increases by $10,000.

The y-intercept, b, tells us the price of the house when the independent variable is 0. In this case, it is the price of a house with no features.

Once we have trained a linear regression model on a dataset of houses, we can use it to predict the price of any new house. We simply need to plug the features of the new house into the model and it will output the predicted price.

Linear regression is a powerful tool for house pricing, but it is important to note that it is not perfect. The accuracy of the model depends on the quality of the data that it is trained on. If the data is not representative of the real world, then the model will not be very accurate.

Another limitation of linear regression is that it can only model linear relationships. In the real world, there are often nonlinear relationships between variables. For example, the price of a house may not increase linearly with the number of bedrooms. In these cases, we may need to use a more complex machine learning algorithm, such as a decision tree or a random forest.

Overall, linear regression is a good starting point for house pricing. It is relatively easy to understand and implement, and it can be very accurate if the data is good. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations and to use it in conjunction with other machine learning algorithms when necessary.
